# :fork_and_knife:Instabot (for food-related hashtagged images) 

## Description
Created as a fun way to practice using Selenium in Python and to automate liking/commenting food images under specific food related hashtags. The idea of this project came from wanting to grow my food Instagram account in followers and interactions. 

## Files
- main.py: python program that runs the automatic liking and commenting
- venv: virtual environment

## How to run the script
- Download the files
- Make sure you have python3, virtual environment, and pip3 installed
- Go into the config.py file and type in your username, password, and amount of likes & comments you want automated
  - In terminal:
    - go into the instabot directory (wherever you have it stored on your laptop)
    - activate the virtual environment by doing 'source venv/bin/activate'
    - run the program by doing 'python3 main.py'
  - From here on out, let the instabot do its thing!

## Imported Libraries
- Selenium (webdriver)

## Downloads
